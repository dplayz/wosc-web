Based on Minecraft tweets, and current pre-releases and betas, 1.19 will come at June 7, with unknown timezone yet.\
\
For the PH Side, update is expected to be released on June 8.\
\
The update will get supported ASAP because Mojang is serving the 1.19 BDS by the time as I'm writing this.\
\
Some updates that are expected:\

* XP Glitch is patched\
  (we refused to update on 1.18.33 until next update releases as it does not impose security vulnerability)\
* Ancient Cities, Warden\
* Swamp, Frogs, Mud Blocks\
* Goat Horn\
* Allay\
  (Minecraft Live 2021 Mob Vote Winner)\
* Chest Boats\
* Disc Fragments\
* and more... \
  (Please check 1.19.0 Beta MInecraft BE Changelogs)\
  \
  We'll update it for more information -\
